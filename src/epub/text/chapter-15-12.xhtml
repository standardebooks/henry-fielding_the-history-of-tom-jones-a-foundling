				<p epub:type="bridgehead">A discovery made by Partridge.</p>
			</header>
			<p>While Jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity, Partridge came capering into the room, as was his custom when he brought, or fancied he brought, any good tidings. He had been despatched that morning by his master, with orders to endeavour, by the servants of Lady Bellaston, or by any other means, to discover whither Sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a joyful countenance told our hero that he had found the lost bird. “I have seen, sir,” says he, “Black George, the gamekeeper, who is one of the servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town. I knew him presently, though I have not seen him these several years; but you know, sir, he is a very remarkable man, or, to use a purer phrase, he hath a most remarkable beard, the largest and blackest I ever saw. It was some time, however, before Black George could recollect me.”⁠—“Well, but what is your good news?” cries Jones; “what do you know of my Sophia?”⁠—“You shall know presently, sir,” answered Partridge, “I am coming to it as fast as I can. You are so impatient, sir, you would come at the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative. As I was saying, sir, it was some time before he recollected my face.”⁠—“Confound your face!” cries Jones, “what of my Sophia?”⁠—“Nay, sir,” answered Partridge, “I know nothing more of Madam Sophia than what I am going to tell you; and I should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me you will frighten all of it out of my head, or, to use a purer phrase, out of my memory. I never saw you look so angry since the day we left Upton, which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand years.”⁠—“Well, pray go on your own way,” said Jones: “you are resolved to make me mad I find.”⁠—“Not for the world,” answered Partridge, “I have suffered enough for that already; which, as I said, I shall bear in my remembrance the longest day I have to live.”⁠—“Well, but Black George?” cries Jones.⁠—“Well, sir, as I was saying, it was a long time before he could recollect me; for, indeed, I am very much altered since I saw him. <i xml:lang="la">Non sum qualis eram.</i> I have had troubles in the world, and nothing alters a man so much as grief. I have heard it will change the colour of a man’s hair in a night. However, at last, know me he did, that’s sure enough; for we are both of an age, and were at the same charity school. George was a great dunce, but no matter for that; all men do not thrive in the world according to their learning. I am sure I have reason to say so; but it will be all one a thousand years hence. Well, sir, where was I?⁠—Oh⁠—well, we no sooner knew each other, than, after many hearty shakes by the hand, we agreed to go to an alehouse and take a pot, and by good luck the beer was some of the best I have met with since I have been in town. Now, sir, I am coming to the point; for no sooner did I name you, and told him that you and I came to town together, and had lived together ever since, than he called for another pot, and swore he would drink to your health; and indeed he drank your health so heartily that I was overjoyed to see there was so much gratitude left in the world; and after we had emptied that pot I said I would buy my pot too, and so we drank another to your health; and then I made haste home to tell you the news.”</p>
			<p>“What news?” cries Jones, “you have not mentioned a word of my Sophia!”⁠—“Bless me! I had like to have forgot that. Indeed, we mentioned a great deal about young Madam Western, and George told me all; that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blifil is coming to town in order to be married to her. He had best make haste then, says I, or somebody will have her before he comes; and, indeed, says I, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Seagrim, it is a thousand pities somebody should not have her; for he certainly loves her above all the women in the world. I would have both you and she know, that it is not for her fortune he follows her; for I can assure you, as to matter of that, there is another lady, one of much greater quality and fortune than she can pretend to, who is so fond of somebody that she comes after him day and night.”</p>
			<p>Here Jones fell into a passion with Partridge, for having, as he said, betrayed him; but the poor fellow answered, he had mentioned no name: “Besides, sir,” said he, “I can assure you George is sincerely your friend, and wished <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blifil at the devil more than once; nay, he said he would do anything in his power upon earth to serve you; and so I am convinced he will. Betray you, indeed! why, I question whether you have a better friend than George upon earth, except myself, or one that would go farther to serve you.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” says Jones, a little pacified, “you say this fellow, who, I believe, indeed, is enough inclined to be my friend, lives in the same house with Sophia?”</p>
			<p>“In the same house!” answered Partridge; “why, sir, he is one of the servants of the family, and very well dressed I promise you he is; if it was not for his black beard you would hardly know him.”</p>
			<p>“One service then at least he may do me,” says Jones: “sure he can certainly convey a letter to my Sophia.”</p>
			<p>“You have hit the nail <i xml:lang="la">ad unguem</i>” cries Partridge; “how came I not to think of it? I will engage he shall do it upon the very first mentioning.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then,” said Jones, “do you leave me at present, and I will write a letter, which you shall deliver to him tomorrow morning; for I suppose you know where to find him.”</p>
			<p>“O yes, sir,” answered Partridge, “I shall certainly find him again; there is no fear of that. The liquor is too good for him to stay away long. I make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in town.”</p>
			<p>“So you don’t know the street then where my Sophia is lodged?” cries Jones.</p>
			<p>“Indeed, sir, I do,” says Partridge.</p>
			<p>“What is the name of the street?” cries Jones.</p>
			<p>“The name, sir? why, here, sir, just by,” answered Partridge, “not above a street or two off. I don’t, indeed, know the very name; for, as he never told me, if I had asked, you know, it might have put some suspicion into his head. No, no, sir, let me alone for that. I am too cunning for that, I promise you.”</p>
			<p>“Thou art most wonderfully cunning, indeed,” replied Jones; “however, I will write to my charmer, since I believe you will be cunning enough to find him tomorrow at the alehouse.”</p>
			<p>And now, having dismissed the sagacious Partridge, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jones sat himself down to write, in which employment we shall leave him for a time. And here we put an end to the fifteenth book.</p>
